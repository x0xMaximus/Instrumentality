# Humans as Objects: Instrumentality

## Description

Objectification often occurs with an expectation of privacy, using a transient cache, session and cookie history in the post-incognito web browser world.

The software emulates a person using their computer to browse the Internet. Interspersed in the pedestrian activity, a new session takes place that performs a fleeting period of indulgence, by browsing the content and sites collected from from the question: “What institution, news outlet, media provider, or entertainment company objectives either gender for personal gain?”.

The autonomous computer will attempt to provide a voyeuristic glimpse into anonymous individual’s practice of objectification.
